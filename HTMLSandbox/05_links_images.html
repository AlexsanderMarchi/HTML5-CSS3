    When getting a random image, it can be either chosen from Unsplash's photos featured photos:

https://source.unsplash.com/random

Or, you can select that image from just the featured photos:

https://source.unsplash.com/featured

Optionally, to specify a size, place it at the end of the URL:

https://source.unsplash.com/random/1600x900 https://source.unsplash.com/all/1600x900

Random from a given user
To choose a random photo from a specific user, the format follows that of selecting from a category:

https://source.unsplash.com/user/{USERNAME}/

Optionally, to specify a size, place it at the end of the path:

https://source.unsplash.com/user/scottwebb/1600x900 https://source.unsplash.com/user/scottwebb/featured/1600x900

Random from a user's likes
You can also choose a random photo from a user's liked photos:

https://source.unsplash.com/user/{USERNAME}/likes

Optionally, to specify a size, place it at the end of the path:

https://source.unsplash.com/user/aaron/likes/1600x900

Narrowing random selection further with search terms
Using any of the above formats - random from all or featured photos, filtering by collection or by user - you can narrow the selection of a random photo even further by supplying a list of comma-separated search terms on the end of the URL.

For example, to get a random featured photo that matches the terms "apple" and "desk":

https://source.unsplash.com/random?apple,desk

Optionally, to specify a size, place it at the end of the path:

https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900?apple,desk https://source.unsplash.com/featured/1600x900?apple,desk

Photo of the Day or Week
All of the above URL's will give you a new image each time they are requested (provided there are enough photos to choose from given the filtering). However each can also be limited to only updating once per day or week. To do so, simply add /daily or /weekly.

For example:

https://source.unsplash.com/daily

https://source.unsplash.com/user/scottwebb/featured/1600x900/daily

https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/weekly?apple,desk
